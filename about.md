With knowledge in multiple languages, including *bash*, *c#*, *python*,          *javascript* (and others), i designed, prototype, developed, and deployed services for backends, frontends, mobile, also infra structure and cloud services.
I am not limited by any framework, or language. Everyday learning a new tool to add in my toolkit. This allows me to find the best solution for every situation.

Having this knowledge always gave me the sacurity to choose the best framework to work, based on the team's skillset.

With more than a decade of experience, I learned different methods to analise, measure, and solve problems inside the project scope.

After some time, I decided to start a Youtube channel, to post about what is happening in the Development world. The blog i maintain is ,in a way, an extension of this idea of sharing knowledge.
